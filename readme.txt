== Installation ==

There are two methods to install the plugin:

**Copy the file to the WordPress plugins directory:**

1. Make a new directory in [SITE_ROOT]/wp-content/plugins called woocommerce-fat-zebra-gateway
2. Copy the file class-wc-fatzebra.php to this new directory.
3. Activate the newly installed plugin in the WordPress Plugin Manager.


**Install the plugin from WordPress:**

1. Search for the WooCommerce Fat Zebra plugin from the WordPress Plugin Manager.
2. Install the plugin.
3. Activate the newly installed plugin.

== Configuration ==

1. Visit the WooCommerce settings page, and click on the Payment Gateways tab.
2. Click on Fat Zebra to edit the settings. If you do not see Fat Zebra in the list at the top of the screen make sure you have activated the plug in in the WordPress Plug in Manager.
3. Enable the Payment Method, name it Credit Card (this will show up on the payment page your customer sees) and add in your credentials. Click Save.
4. Optional: Display the Fat Zebra logo on your checkout page - we will love you forever if you choose this option.

You should now be able to test the purchases via Fat Zebra.
